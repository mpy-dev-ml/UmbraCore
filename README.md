UmbraCore is built to extend the foundation of [Restic](https://restic.net), a remarkable open-source backup programme that has set the standard for secure, efficient, and reliable backups. In particular, we have focussed extensively on enabling [Restic](https://restic.net) to work more fully within Swift sandboxed environments as well as using native macOS security features coupled with Restic for those of us who struggle to remember passwords. 

We are deeply grateful to the Restic team for their years of dedication in creating and maintaining such an exceptional tool, without whom UmbraCore would not exist. This bears noting as UmbraCore is not designed in any way to replace Restic but, rather, further extend its capabilities to ever more users who will undoubtedly come to use, admire, and love [Restic](https://restic.net) as much as we do.

Our mission with UmbraCore is to:
- Extend Restic's capabilities specifically for macOS application development
- Provide a type-safe, Swift-native interface
- Maintain complete compatibility with Restic's core functionality
- Provide a solid development platform for novel Restic apps for devs and users alike

If you find UmbraCore useful, please consider:

- [Contributing to Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Joining the Restic community](https://forum.restic.net)

## Quick Start
- Complete developer documentation is update frequently and available at [UmbraCore Dot Dev](https://umbracore.dev)

### Requirements
- macOS 14.0+
- Swift 5.9.2+
- Bazel 8.1.0+

### Installation
1. Add UmbraCore to your dependencies in `MODULE.bazel`:
```python
swift_deps = use_extension("@rules_swift_package_manager//:extensions.bzl", "swift_deps")
swift_deps.from_json(
    deps_json = "//:.deps.json",
)
```

2. Add the dependency to your `.deps.json`:
```json
{
  "umbracore": {
    "url": "https://github.com/mpy-dev-ml/UmbraCore.git",
    "version": "0.2.0"
  }
}
```

## Core Applications
UmbraCore powers several macOS backup management tools:
- ResticBar (macOS menu bar app for developers)
- Rbx (VS Code extension)
- Rbum (user-friendly GUI)

## Features

### Implemented
- Secure keychain operations with XPC service
- Repository password handling
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Thread-safe operations
- SwiftyBeaver logging integration
- Modular architecture
- Extensive test coverage

### In Development
- SSH key management
- Cloud provider credentials

## Architecture

### Core Libraries
- **SecurityTypes**: Base security primitives and protocols
- **CryptoTypes**: Cryptographic operations and types
- **UmbraLogging**: Centralised logging infrastructure

### Service Layer
- **UmbraKeychainService**: Secure keychain operations
- **UmbraCryptoService**: Cryptographic operations service
- **UmbraBookmarkService**: File system bookmark management
- **UmbraXPC**: XPC communication infrastructure

### Features
- **ResticCLIHelper**: Command-line interface integration
- **Repositories**: Repository management and operations
- **Snapshots**: Snapshot creation and management
- **Config**: Configuration and settings management
- **Logging**: Privacy-aware structured logging
- **ErrorHandling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Autocomplete**: Context-aware command completion

### Examples
The `/Examples` directory contains sample implementations demonstrating correct usage of UmbraCore APIs and patterns. These examples are kept separate from the main codebase to prevent build/test interference while still providing reference implementations.

## Cross-Functional Cryptographic Strategy

UmbraCore implements a dual-library cryptographic approach to support both native macOS security features and cross-process operations:

### CryptoKit Integration
- Native macOS security features for ResticBar
- Hardware-backed security operations
- Secure key storage with Secure Enclave
- Optimised for sandboxed environments

### CryptoSwift Integration
- Cross-process operations for Rbum and Rbx
- Platform-independent implementation
- Flexible XPC service support
- Consistent cross-application behaviour

### KeyManager
The KeyManager orchestrates cryptographic operations across both implementations:
- Intelligent routing between CryptoKit and CryptoSwift
- Unified key lifecycle management
- Secure key storage and rotation
- Context-aware security boundaries
- Cross-process synchronisation

This dual-library strategy enables UmbraCore to provide:
- Native security features in ResticBar
- Cross-functional operation in Rbum and Rbx
- Consistent security model across all implementations
- Flexible deployment options

## Development

### Building
```bash
# Generate/update BUILD files
bazelisk run //:update_build_files

# Build all targets
bazelisk build //...

# Run tests
bazelisk test //...
```

### Repository Management
UmbraCore uses a clean Git repository approach with:
- Development scripts and utilities kept locally but excluded from Git
- Production code focused on the main branch
- Clear separation between build outputs and source code

If you're contributing, please note that certain file types are excluded from Git tracking:
- Python scripts (.py)
- Shell scripts (.sh)
- Dot files (.dot)
- Most .md files (except README.md files)
- .txt files (except test_targets.txt and production_targets.txt)
- Various analyser and utility files

This approach keeps the repository clean while maintaining the necessary tools for development locally.

### Documentation
The complete documentation is available at [UmbraCore Dot Dev](https://umbracore.dev).

## Security
UmbraCore prioritises security through:
- Secure keychain integration
- XPC service isolation
- Regular dependency scanning
- Comprehensive security testing

## Dependencies

UmbraCore builds upon the work of several outstanding open-source projects:

### [Restic](https://restic.net)
A truly unique backup programme that sets the standard for secure, efficient, and reliable backups. The dedication of the Restic team in creating and maintaining this exceptional tool has been instrumental in making UmbraCore possible.

### [CryptoSwift](https://cryptoswift.io)
An outstanding cryptography framework created and maintained by [Marcin Krzyżanowski](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim). We are grateful for the years of work that have gone into making this comprehensive, pure-Swift implementation of popular cryptographic algorithms. CryptoSwift's excellent design and thorough testing have been crucial for UmbraCore's security features.

### [SwiftyBeaver](https://swiftybeaver.com)
A sophisticated logging system developed by [Sebastian Kreutzberger](https://github.com/skreutzberger) and contributors. SwiftyBeaver's elegant API design and robust feature set have significantly enhanced UmbraCore's logging capabilities. We deeply appreciate the maintainers' commitment to providing such a reliable and well-documented logging solution.
