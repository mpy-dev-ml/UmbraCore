/**
 # UmbraCore Security Provider Core
 
 This file implements the core functionality of the security provider, serving as the central
 component that coordinates between the cryptographic services and key management systems.
 
 ## Responsibilities
 
 * Route security operations to the appropriate specialised handlers
 * Coordinate between cryptographic and key management services
 * Provide configuration building and validation
 * Handle errors and ensure consistent error reporting
 
 ## Design Pattern
 
 This class follows the Facade design pattern, providing a simpler interface to the complex
 security subsystem by coordinating between different components:
 
 * ConfigBuilder: Creates and validates security configurations
 * OperationsHandler: Routes operations to the appropriate service
 * CryptoService: Handles cryptographic operations
 * KeyManager: Handles key management operations
 
 ## Security Considerations
 
 * Centralised security validation ensures consistent security policies
 * Error handling preserves security context without leaking sensitive information
 * Operations are routed based on explicit operation types rather than complex logic
